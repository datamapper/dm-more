FIXME
====
Add ability to have a unique relationship when joining through remixable
  This is stubbed at remixable.rb @~ line 223; waiting on stategic eager loading
  M:M Video.remix n, :commentables, :as => "comments", :for => "User", :unique => false
  M:M Article.remix n, :views, :for => "User", :unique => true
    in the generated table article_views article_id and user_id would be a unique key, 
      only counting a users viewing of an article once


TODO
====  
- Test Unary remixes User.remix n, :comments, :for => "User"
- Test nested remix with M:M through Remixable, :for => "Class"
- Test with Namespaced Models

- Remixing a non-remixable just throws an exception . . . should have a .remixable? on DataMapper::Resource's
  and if its not remixable raise Exception, "XXX is not remixable"

- Harvest Class methods (including it into Remixed Model gets the instance methods, but not class methods...)

- Squash protection;
  IF    ClassA => remix ModuleB, :table_name => "squashme" 
  AND   ClassC => remix ModuleB, :table_name => "squashme" #SQUASHED THAT TABLE

CONSIDERATIONS
==============
- Customizing Assocations           (http://datamapper.org/docs/associations.html)
- Adding Conditions to Associations (http://datamapper.org/docs/associations.html)

- Defining class name specifically during remix (rather than implied from :table_name)
  remix, :class_name => "MyClassName" 
      #instead of using table_name? Too Many Options or having Remixable default class name...

  EXAMPLE:
  User.remix :addressables,
    :table_name => "user_addresses"
    :as => "addresses"
    :class_name => "address"
    
- Remixable Module defines class name

  EXAMPLE:
  module :addressables
    is :remixable, 
      :suffix => "address",
      :class_name => "address"
  
  a = Address.new  #Instead of a = UserAddress.new
  User.user_addresses << a
  User.addresses << a
  
  Benefit: On remixing you dont end up with crazy amounts of classes/names UserAddress, AccountAddress, etc
  Problem: How does enhancing work (since all Address's will use same class)
