Story: remote app wants to create a resource
  As a remote app
  I want to create a resource
  So that I can store some data about a particular item
  
  Scenario: remote app supplies a new valid Resource 
    Given a valid DataMapper::Resource
    When I try to save the Resource
    Then the Resource should save

  Scenario: remote app supplies a new invalid Resource 
    Given a valid DataMapper::Resource
    When I make invalid changes to that Resource
    When I try to save the Resource
    Then the Resource should not save
    
  Scenario: remote app supplies a new valid Resource associated with another new valid Resource
    Given a new Resource
    And another new Resource associated with the first
    When I try to save the first Resource
    Then both Resources should save
    
  Scenario: remote app supplies a new invalid Resource associated with another new valid Resource
    Given a new invalid Resouce
    And another new Resource associated with the first
    When I try to save the first Resource
    Neither Resource should save
