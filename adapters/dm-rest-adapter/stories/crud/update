Story: remote app wants to update a resource
  As a remote app
  I want to modify a resource
  So that it's information represents the correct state

  Scenario: remote app updates with changes made to a resource's state
    Given a local representation of a remote Resource
    When I make valid changes to that Resource
    And I try to save the Resource
    Then the Resource should save 
    
  Scenario: remote app updates with invalid changes to a resource's state
    Given a local representation of a remote Resource
    When I make invalid changes to that Resource
    And I try to save the Resource
    Then the Resource should not save
    
  Scenario: remote app updates with changes to an object and one of its children
    Given a local representation of a remote Resource
    And a local representation of one of that Resource's child Resources
    When I make valid changes to the parent Resource
    And I make valid changes to the child Resource
    Then both Resources should save
    
  Scenario: remote app updates with valid changes to an object and invalid changes to one of its children

    And I make invalid changes to the child Resource
    Then neither Resource should save
