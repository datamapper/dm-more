Story: remote app wants to access one or more Resources
  As a remote app
  I want to get one or more Resources
  So that I can take an action based upon the information

  Scenario: GET <resource>
    Given a type of Resource
    When I request all of the Resources of that type
    Then I should not receive an empty list
    
  Scenario: GET <resource>/<id>
    Given a type of Resource
    And the ID of an existing Resource
    When I request the Resource
    Then I should receive that Resource
    
  Scenario: GET <resource>/<invalid id>
    Given a type of Resource
    And the ID of a nonexistent Resource
    When I request the Resource
    Then I should get nothing in return
  
  Scenario: GET <nested resource>/<id>
    Given a Resource that returns associated resources
    And the ID of an existing Resource that has associated Resources
    And I have all of the necessary class definitions 
    When I GET <nested resource>/<id>
    Then I should get the Resource
    And the Resource will have associated Resources
    
  Scenario: GET <nested resource>/<id> but we are missing some class definitions
    Given a Resource that returns associated resources
    And the ID of an existing Resource that has associated Resources
    And I do not have all of the necessary class definitions 
    When I GET <nested resource>/<id>
    Then I should get an Exception
